Computer Engineering student passionate about building intelligent systems at the intersection of software and hardware. I bring strong skills in machine learning, systems programming, algorithms, and autonomous systems development, with hands-on experience across the full technology stack. From low-level FPGA design to high-level AI applications. I thrive on solving complex technical problems and am particularly drawn to projects that combine analytical thinking with real-world impact.
