Iâ€™m a curious human who loves two things: making AI make sense (hello, Explainable AI) and saving the planet (starting with climate change). With a background in software development, I enjoy building things that actually do somethingâ€”ideally, something good.

I spend my days learning how machines can understand the messy beauty of natureâ€”and my weekends letting the ocean remind me how little I know. ðŸŒŠ

When I'm not working on clearer, smarter AI for climate science, youâ€™ll find me surfing waves, scuba diving with fish, or just daydreaming about coral reefs. I believe the best ideas come from mixing data with saltwater and logic with a little chaos.

Iâ€™m here to build tech that doesnâ€™t just crunch numbers, but actually cares about the planet. And maybe, just maybe, convince a robot to go surfing one day.
