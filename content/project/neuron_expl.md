+++ The Neuron Explanation project aims to understand what deep neural networks (CNN, LLMs) learn during the training process by analyzing what individual neurons are able to recognize in terms of concepts (e.g., cat, building, etc). Specifically, we aim to achieve this goal by associating logical rules (e.g., (Cat OR Dog) AND NOT person)) to each neuron that express the (spatial) alignment between neurons activations and concept locations. These rules are usually extracted by combining search algorithms, clustering algorithms and statistical analysis of neurons activation.
