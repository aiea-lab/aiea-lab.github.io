The Faithful Reasoning project focuses on combining the flexbility of LLMs and the rigorousness of Symbolic Reasoning, and generate faithful Neuro-symbolic reasoning for high-stakes use cases, such as determining whether a user has violated Terms of Service. 
Neuro-symbolic AI (also known as NeSy) is a field that combines the generalizability of Neural Networks and interpretability and control of Symbolic AI. The highly structured setup with potential capability for formal verification is a great fit for the legal field. Its generalizability is promising to lift up the burden of heavy legal document review and drafting
