Leilani H. Gilpin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of
Computer Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.  Her research
focuses on the design and analysis of methods for autonomous systems
to explain themselves.  Her work has applications to robust
decision-making, system debugging, and accountability.  Her current
work examines how generative models can be used in iterative XAI
stress testing.

She holds a PhD in Computer Science from MIT, an M.S. in Computational
and Mathematical Engineering from Stanford University, and a B.S. in
Mathematics (with honors), B.S. in Computer Science (with highest
honors), and a music minor from UC San Diego.  Outside of research,
Leilani enjoys swimming, cooking, hiking, and org-mode.
