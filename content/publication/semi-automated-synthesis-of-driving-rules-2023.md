abstract = "Autonomous vehicles must operate in a complex environment with various social norms and expectations. While most of the work on securing autonomous vehicles has focused on safety, we argue that we also need to monitor for deviations from various societal “common sense” rules to identify attacks against autonomous systems. In this paper, we provide a first approach to encoding and understanding these common-sense driving behaviors by semi-automatically extracting rules from driving manuals. We encode our driving rules in a formal specification and make our rules available online for other researchers."
