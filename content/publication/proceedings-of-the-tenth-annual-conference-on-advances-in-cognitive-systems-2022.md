abstract = "We hope you will enjoy these proceedings of the Tenth Annual Conference on Advances in Cognitive Systems (ACS). The event was the first hybrid meeting of ACS in is history. It took place virtually via Zoom and physically at George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia, from Saturday, November 19, to Tuesday, November 22, 2022. We are so delighted to be part of continuing this important venue that focuses on the original long-standing goals and challenges of artificial intelligence research. The conference program consisted of 37 papers consisting of ten 30-minute long talks, fifteen 20-minute short talks, twelve posters, three invited talks, two workshops, and a community panel discussion. This year’s Simon Prize Lecture was delivered by Anthony Cohn, Professor of Automated Reasoning at the University of Leeds. More than 200 people attended both in person and virtually. We were fortunate to have the organizational contributions of our local chair, Mihai Boicu of George Mason University, and of the members of the ACS Organizing Committee: Paul Bello, Pat Langley, Sergei Nirenburg, and Matt Klenk. We also thank Mark Burstein, Ken Forbus, Henry Lieberman, Marge McShane, John Laird, and Alexis Kilayko for their many suggestions and contributions. Finally we thank our sponsors, Smart Information Flow Technologies (SIFT) and George Mason University's Institute for Digital Innovation. The latter provided space and technical support that allowed us to produce a high-quality in-person and virtual event. We invite you to visit the Advances in Cognitive Systems YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/ @advancesincognitivesystems4184) which has videos of the presentations, invited talks, tutorials, and the panel discussion."
